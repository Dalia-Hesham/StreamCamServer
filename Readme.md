# WebSocket Secure (WSS) Camera Stream Application

This project provides a secure, real-time camera streaming application using Flask and WebSockets over HTTPS (WSS).

---

## **Steps to Set Up the Application**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install OpenSSL on Windows (if applicable):
   - **Install via Precompiled Binaries**:
     - Download OpenSSL for Windows from [Shining Light Productions](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).
     - Add OpenSSL to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

   - **Verify Installation**:
     - Open a terminal and run:
       ```bash
       openssl version
       ```
     - You should see the installed OpenSSL version.

4. Generate SSL certificates:
   - Open a terminal in the project directory.
   - Run the following command to create the certificates in the `certificates/` folder:
     ```bash
     mkdir certificates
     openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
         -keyout certificates/private.key \
         -out certificates/certificate.crt
     ```
   - You will be prompted to provide details such as country, organization name, etc. leave them blank for development purposes.
   - The private key will be saved as `certificates/private.key`.
   - The certificate will be saved as `certificates/certificate.crt`.

5. Start the Flask application with HTTPS and WebSocket Secure (WSS):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open the application in your browser:
   - Navigate to:
     ```
     https://<your-domain-or-ip>:5000
     ```
   - Accept the self-signed certificate warning if using self-signed certificates (for development).
   - The application should load, and the camera stream will be displayed.
